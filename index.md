## About
<p style="font-size:0.8em">
Welcome, and thank you for visiting my homepage.<br>
<br>
I am currently a student at <span style="font-weight: 550;">CHA University Graduate School of Medicine</span>, with a strong academic interest in artificial intelligence and its applications in medicine. Prior to pursuing medical training, I received my master’s degree from <span style="font-weight: 550;">Kim Jaechul Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence at KAIST</span>, under the supervision of Professor <span style="font-weight: 550;">Juho Lee</span>, following a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering, also from <span style="font-weight: 550;">KAIST</span>.<br>
<br>
During my master’s studies, I focused on generative models—particularly diffusion models and flow matching—with an emphasis on extending their applicability beyond image-based domains. Through this work, I developed a growing interest in AI-driven drug discovery and protein generation. These experiences ultimately shaped my broader vision of artificial intelligence as a transformative force in medicine and motivated my decision to pursue medical training.<br>
<br>
I believe, as many do, that the integration of artificial intelligence into clinical practice will fundamentally expand the boundaries of medicine in the near future. I hope to contribute to this ongoing transformation as a clinician-scientist. I welcome any discussions on medical AI research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the future role of artificial intelligence in clinical medicine.
